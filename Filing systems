Computer filing systems, also known as file systems, are methods and data structures that operating systems use to manage files on a disk or partition. 
These systems define how data is stored, accessed, and managed on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and USB flash drives. Here are some common file systems:

1) NTFS (New Technology File System):

Used by Windows operating systems.
Supports large files and volumes.
Provides security features like file encryption and permissions.
Includes features like file compression, shadow copies, and hard links.

2) FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32):

An older file system used by Windows.
Compatible with many operating systems.
Limited to 4GB maximum file size and 2TB maximum partition size.
Commonly used for USB flash drives and external storage.

3) exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table):

Designed for flash drives.
Overcomes the 4GB file size limit of FAT32.
Supported by Windows, macOS, and Linux with appropriate drivers.

4) ext3/ext4 (Third/Fourth Extended Filesystem):

Commonly used by Linux operating systems.
Ext4 is an improvement over ext3 with larger volume and file sizes, faster performance, and better reliability.
Supports journaling, which helps prevent data corruption.

5) Btrfs (B-tree File System):

A newer file system for Linux.
Designed for high performance and advanced features.
Supports snapshots, pooling, and built-in RAID.

6) APFS (Apple File System):

The default file system for macOS High Sierra and later.
Optimized for SSDs and flash storage.
Provides strong encryption, space sharing, and fast directory sizing.
