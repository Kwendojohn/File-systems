Computer filing systems, also known as file systems, are methods and data structures that operating systems use to manage files on a disk or partition. 
These systems define how data is stored, accessed, and managed on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and USB flash drives. Here are some common file systems:

1) exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table)

Usage: Designed for flash drives and SD cards.
Compatibility: Widely supported by Windows and macOS, and with additional drivers, it can be used on Linux.
Maximum File Size: 16 exabytes (theoretical), 128 petabytes (practical).
Maximum Volume Size: 128 petabytes.

Features:
Overcomes the 4GB file size limit of FAT32.
Good for flash memory due to low overhead.
No journaling, which can reduce wear on flash memory.

2) FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32)

Usage: Common for USB flash drives and external hard drives.
Compatibility: Supported by most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Maximum File Size: 4GB.
Maximum Volume Size: 2TB.

Features:
Improved over FAT with larger volume and file size limits.
Still widely compatible.
No built-in file permissions or security features.
No journaling, which can lead to data corruption in case of power failures or crashes.

3) NTFS (New Technology File System)

Usage: Default file system for Windows operating systems.
Compatibility: Fully supported by Windows, read-only support on macOS, and full support with additional drivers on Linux.
Maximum File Size: 16TB (theoretical), 256TB (practical with 64KB clusters).
Maximum Volume Size: 16EB (exabytes) (theoretical), 256TB (practical with 64KB clusters).

Features:
Advanced security with file and folder permissions.
Supports file compression.
Journaling, which helps prevent data corruption.
Supports large files and volumes.
Includes features like shadow copies, disk quotas, and encryption.
